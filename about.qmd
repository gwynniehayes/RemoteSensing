## Types of Remote Sensing

1.  LiDAR

    Light Detection and Ranging, is a method of remote sensing that uses light from pulsed lasers to measure the distances pulsed to get an accurate 3-D readings of the land.

2.  MODIS

    Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, is an instrument on the Terra and Aqua Satellites that scan the Earth's surface as the satellites orbit. MODIS views the entire Earth every 1-2 days.

3.  InSAR

    Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, is imaging that maps ground deformations. InSAR uses radar imaging that penetrates cloud and weather coverage to get accurate readings of the Earth's surface.
