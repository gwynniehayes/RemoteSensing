    "text": "Uses of Artificial Intelligence in Remote Sensing\n\nWhat is Image Classification?\nFrom viso.ai\n“A computer analyzes an image in the form of pixels. It does it by considering the image as an array of matrices, with the size of the matrix dependent on the image resolution. Put simply, image classification in a computer’s view is the analysis of this statistical data using algorithms. In digital image processing, image classification is done by automatically grouping pixels into specified categories, so-called “classes.”\n\n\nHow does Object Detection in AI work?\nFrom Daten and Wissen\n“AI identifies objects in images by looking for visual features that distinguish one object from another. These could be edges, textures, or shapes that appear in the image. Through machine learning, AI becomes proficient at recognizing these features, even in unfamiliar settings. It’s similar to how humans learn to recognize objects: through repeated exposure and pattern recognition. The more data the AI gets, the better it becomes at identifying objects, even in challenging environments like low light or busy scenes.”\n\n\nHow does AI do Pattern Recognition?\nFrom viso.ai\n“AI pattern recognition using neural networks is currently the most popular method for pattern detection. Neural networks are based on parallel subunits referred to as neurons that simulate human decision-making. They can be viewed as massively parallel computing systems consisting of a huge number of simple processors with many interconnections (Neurons).\nThe most popular and successful form of machine learning using neural networks is deep learning, which applies deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to solve classification tasks.\nToday, neural network pattern recognition has the edge over other methods because it can change the weights repeatedly on iteration patterns. In recent years, deep learning has proven to be the most successful method to solve recognition tasks. For more information and detailed descriptions of what neural networks are all about, we recommend you read our guide about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.”\n\n\nHow does AI achieve Feature Extraction?\nFrom IBM\n“First, the model takes in input data, then the feature extractor transforms the data into a numerical representation that can be used to compute the dimensionality reduction methods for feature extraction. These representations are stored in feature vectors for the model to perform algorithms for data reduction.”\n\n\nWhat is Data Fusion?\nFrom Windward\n“Here’s how data fusion happens:\n\nData acquisition and validation: data is continuously collected from various sources and standardized for analysis. Before moving forward, it is validated to remove inaccuracies, and redundant or erroneous information.\nFeasibility and assignment: the validated data is evaluated to ensure it reflects realistic behavior patterns, after which it is assigned to the most appropriate entities, using advanced matching techniques.\nConflict resolution and refinement: in cases of conflicting data assignments, a scoring mechanism resolves any ambiguities. The data is then further refined to maintain the accuracy and integrity of entity paths.\nData optimization: the final step involves streamlining the dataset, retaining only the most relevant information to ensure efficient processing in downstream applications.”"

    "text": "This first app is a program I made that takes the input of an image that the user can upload, then it makes the image into a raster and averages out the colors in the image into a specified number of groups. The output of this program can detect buildings and trees in images which is similar to what remote sensing can do. This however is a much more manual process then what machine learning in remote sensing can do.\n\n\nThis is package that is accessible in R, called “osmdata” that detects specific things in a map in a specified location. It can detect buildings, roads, water, forests and many other things. I have this set to detect water in an area."

    "text": "There are many ethical issues to consider when talking about remote sensing. These are important to consider because there is very little public conversation about what remote sensing is. It is not an issue that is brushed under the table but it is not something that is widely discussed.\n\nPrivacy and Surveillance:\n\nUnconsented observation:\nRemote sensing can capture data about individuals, communities, or private properties without their knowledge or consent.\n\n\nMass surveillance:\nGovernments or companies might use remote sensing for population monitoring or political control, raising civil liberty concerns.\n\n\n\nInformed Consent:\nOften, people or communities being observed are unaware that data is being collected about them, which violates the ethical principle of informed consent.\n\n\nData Misuse:\n\nMilitary or political exploitation:\nRemote sensing data can be used for targeting in conflicts or for espionage.\n\n\nCommercial exploitation:\nCompanies may sell or use satellite imagery to exploit natural resources or real estate without local stakeholder involvement.\n\n\n\nBias and Representation:\nData interpretation can be biased, especially when used to inform policies affecting vulnerable communities. Remote sensing may overlook cultural or social contexts, leading to technocratic or top-down decisions that ignore local knowledge.\n\n\nEnvironmental and Social Impact:\nDrone usage may disrupt wildlife or intrude on indigenous lands. Decisions based on remote sensing (e.g., for urban planning, disaster relief) may inadvertently marginalize already disadvantaged populations.\n\n\nData Ownership and Access:\nWho owns the data? Satellite imagery is often controlled by governments or private corporations, limiting transparency and equitable access for affected communities."
