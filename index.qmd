## What is remote sensing?

Remote sensing is the use of satellites or low flying aircrafts to scan the earth in order to obtain geographic information about the area. This data is then stored in digital images, which then can be used with image processing techniques to detect and “sense” specific things in the environment of the image.

This is done by measuring the reflected and emitted radiation from the physical characteristics of the landscape at a distance. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites are a common system used to do remote sensing, see the [Common Questions](about.qmd) page to learn more about different types of remote sensing systems.

## What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is technology that allows machines and computers to perform tasks such as problem solving, decision making, comprehension and creativity to simulate human learning.

There are many different types of artificial intelligence but the one that is most commonly used within remote sensing is machine learning. Machine learning is the ability to use and develop methods to learn and adapt in order to perform tasks without specific instructions.

## Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

Machine learning is used in remote sensing to analyze the large amounts of spatial data that is produced. It can be used for:

1.  Image Classification
2.  Object Detection
3.  Pattern Recognition
4.  Feature Extraction
5.  Environmental Monitoring
6.  Data Fusion
7.  Precision Agriculture
